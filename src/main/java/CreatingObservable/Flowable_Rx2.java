/*n RxJava 2, the RxJava team decided to split the standard Observable into two types:
the regular kind weâ€™ve been looking at throughout this series, and Flowables.

Flowables function in much the same way as Observables, but with one major difference:
Flowables only send as many items as the observer requests. If you have an Observable thatâ€™s
emitting more items than its assigned observer can consume, then you may want to consider switching to a Flowable instead.*/

/*Flowable incurs more of an overhead than a regular Observable, so in the interests of creating a high-performing app,
you should stick with Observables unless you suspect that your application is struggling with backpressure.*/
package CreatingObservable;

import io.reactivex.Flowable;

public class Flowable_Rx2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flowable.just(1,2,3).subscribe(integer -> System.out.println(integer));

    }
}
