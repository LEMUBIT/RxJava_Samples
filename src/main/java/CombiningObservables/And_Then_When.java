/*combine sets of items emitted by two or more Observables by means of Pattern and Plan intermediaries*/
/*The combination of the And, Then, and When operators behave much like the Zip operator, but they do
so by means of intermediate data structures. And accepts two or more Observables and combines the
emissions from each, one set at a time, into Pattern objects. Then operates on such Pattern objects,
transforming them in a Plan. When in turn transforms these various Plan objects into emissions from an Observable.*/

/*These are not part of the core RxJava implementation, but are found as and, then, and when in the rxjava-joins module.*/
