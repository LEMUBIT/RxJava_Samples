/*combine items emitted by two Observables whenever an item from one Observable is
emitted during a time window defined according to an item emitted by the other Observable*/
/*The Join operator combines the items emitted by two Observables, and selects which items to combine based
on duration-windows that you define on a per-item basis. You implement these windows as Observables whose lifespans
begin with each item emitted by either Observable. When such a window-defining Observable either emits an item or completes,
the window for the item it is associated with closes. So long as an itemâ€™s window is open, it will combine with any item emitted
by the other Observable. You define the function by which the items combine.*/
