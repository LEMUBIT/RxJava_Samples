/*combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions*/
/*You can combine the output of multiple Observables so that they act like a single Observable, by using the Merge operator.

Merge may interleave the items emitted by the merged Observables
(a similar operator, Concat, does not interleave items, but emits all of each source Observableâ€™s
items in turn before beginning to emit items from the next source Observable).*/
